# Recipe Chi

Recipe Chi is a web application built with Python/Django that contains two complimentary features:
1. A recipe blog that formats recipes in a way that's easy to read when cooking.
2. A grocery planner. You pick the meals that you're planning on making and Recipe Chi will create a grocery list to let you know what you need to pickup at the supermarket.
